# 3D-interactive-scatter-plot
I would like to design a 3D scatter plot that a user can interact with using mouse and keyboard. For clicking and selecting, for rotating and zooming, and for pop-up data on click.
Use the solar system as a model, where each dot represents a planet and the sun sits at the origin.
Input data would be cartesian coordinates (x, y, z) and some data ("jupiter", colour, info).
Clicking on a dot would "select" it, and then with click-and-drag you would rotate the coordinate system around this dot.
Right-click and shit+right-click would zoom in and out (with selected dot in the middle).
Lastly, for example shift+left-click on a second dot would yield a dashed line from the previously selected dot, displaying the distance between these dots (based on Pythagorean theorem).
I am a complete newbie to Github and I have no idea what I'm doing or if this is the right approach. Fish.
